Calculating the carbon content of liquid fuel is essential for estimating the greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of liquid fuel. The carbon content of liquid fuel is calculated based on the carbon content of the fuel and the molecular weight of carbon dioxide. The method is based on API Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry.
