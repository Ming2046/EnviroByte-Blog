The Alberta TIER (Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction) regulation allows for the aggregation of multiple facilities to create a single reporting entity. The aggregate facility emissions are calculated based on Petrinex data, which provides monthly volumetric data for oil and gas operations in Alberta.

[Petrinex](https://www.petrinex.ca/PD/Pages/default.aspx) is a data warehouse. It has monthly volumetric data from Oil and Gas operations in Alberta, such as production, fuel use, flare, vent data. The volumetric data can be [here]

(https://www.petrinex.ca/PD/Pages/APD.aspx).

Note: data for Saskatchewan and British Columbia are not publicly available.

Check all the monthly files

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import glob
files = glob.glob('*.csv')
files
```

Note:

- macOS is sensitive to the letters \*\.csv or \*\.CSV.
- Windows does not differentiate csv or CSV.

Combine all monthly files into one file

```python
df_all = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f,low_memory=False) for f in glob.glob('*.CSV')],
                    axis = 0,sort = True)
df_all.head()
```

remove unnecessary columns.

```python
col_removal =
['ReportingFacilityProvinceState','ReportingFacilityLocation'
'FacilityLegalSubdivision','FacilitySection','FacilityTownship',
'FacilityRange','FacilityMeridian','SubmissionDate',
'CCICode','ProrationProduct','ProrationFactor',
'FromToIDProvinceState']
df =df_all.drop(columns= col_removal)
df.to_csv('Petrinex_2019.csv',index=False)
```

Select company you want to report

```python
clientA=df[df['OperatorName'].str.contains('clientA')]
clientAFuelFlareVent = clientA[(clientA['ActivityID'] == 'FUEL') | (clientA['ActivityID'] == 'FLARE')| (clientA['ActivityID'] == 'VENT')]
clientAFuelFlareVent
```

Calculate total fuel, flare and vent

```python
df. groupby(['OperatorName','ReportingFacilityID','FromToID','ActivityID','ProductionMonth'])['Volume'].sum()
```
