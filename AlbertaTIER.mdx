The Alberta TIER (Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction) regulation is a key component of Albertaâ€™s climate policy, designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and incentivize technological innovation. The regulation includes specific provisions for various sectors, including the conventional oil and gas sector.

For the conventional oil and gas sector, TIER allows for the aggregation of multiple facilities to create a single reporting entity. The aggregate facility emissions are calculated based on Petrinex data, which provides monthly volumetric data for oil and gas operations in Alberta.

[Petrinex](https://www.petrinex.ca/PD/Pages/default.aspx) is a data warehouse. It has monthly volumetric data from Oil and Gas operations in Alberta, such as production, fuel use, flare, vent data. The volumetric data can be [here](https://www.petrinex.ca/PD/Pages/APD.aspx).

Note: data for Saskatchewan and British Columbia are not publicly available.

Check all the monthly files

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import glob
files = glob.glob('*.csv')
files
```

Note:

- macOS is sensitive to the letters \*\.csv or \*\.CSV.
- Windows does not differentiate csv or CSV.

Combine all monthly files into one file

```python
df_all = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f,low_memory=False) for f in glob.glob('*.CSV')],
                    axis = 0,sort = True)
df_all.head()
```

```python
col_removal =
['ReportingFacilityProvinceState','ReportingFacilityLocation'
'FacilityLegalSubdivision','FacilitySection','FacilityTownship',
'FacilityRange','FacilityMeridian','SubmissionDate',
'CCICode','ProrationProduct','ProrationFactor',
'FromToIDProvinceState']
df =df_all.drop(columns= col_removal)
df.to_csv('Petrinex_2019.csv',index=False)
```
