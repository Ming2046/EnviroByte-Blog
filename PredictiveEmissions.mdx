## PEMS History

Predictive Emissions Monitoring Systems (PEMS) have been around for a long time. They were first introduced in the 1990s as a way to monitor emissions from industrial sources.
PEMS use mathematical models to predict emissions based on process data, such as fuel consumption and operating conditions.
These models are then used to estimate emissions in real-time, allowing operators to monitor their emissions and take corrective action if necessary.

## PEMS Providers

For facilities that look for integrated PEMS solutions, key players such as ABB, Rockwell, and Honeywell
provide comprehensive PEMS offerings that seamlessly integrate with Distributed Control Systems (DCS), data storage systems, and reporting systems.

In the landscape of PEMSs, long-standing players like CMC Solutions have been delivering PEMS solutions for over a decade and installed more than 100 systems for regulatory reporting.

## OpenPEMS&trade;

OpenPEMS&trade; is developed by one of our team members, and it is a free and open-source predictive emissions monitoring system that can help you monitor your emissions in real-time.

OpenPEMS™ is inspired by OpenAI's ethos of accessibility and empowerment. Our vision is to make the Artificial Intelligent (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies
accessible to a wider industrial audience, reducing costs associated with air emissions monitoring.

We expanded traditional PEMS capabilities to include GHG emissions monitoring, which is essential for regulatory compliance and sustainability reporting.

OpenPEMS™ is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows operators to monitor emissions, view historical data, and generate reports easily.

We integrate OpenPEMS™ with our other applications, including EmissionX&trade; for GHG reporting and Reduction in Motion (RIM) for CH4 reporting and reduction
to provide a comprehensive solution for emissions monitoring, reporting, and forecasting (prediction).
