Carbon Reduction and Removal:
Carbon Reduction:

Carbon reduction refers to lowering CO₂ emissions by capturing and storing carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. Soil carbon sequestration reduces atmospheric CO₂ by storing a portion of the carbon fixed by plants in the soil instead of allowing it to be released back into the air.
Carbon Removal:

Carbon removal is the direct extraction of CO₂ from the atmosphere, as plants absorb it for photosynthesis. This carbon is subsequently transferred to the soil through plant residues, root biomass, and litter.
Permanent carbon removal occurs when this carbon is stabilized in the soil for long periods through processes like mineralization or by being stored in deep soil layers where it is less likely to decompose.
