Almost all GHG reporting software on the market operates like a black box to certain degree.
Alberta, as the first province, introduced regulatory GHG reporting. Some Environmental Software, although extremely difficult to use with poor service,
still doing majority of Alberta TIER GHG reporting,

Black box **Enviro**mental **Soft**ware poses many serever problems that reporting companies may not realize, including

# Lack of Transparency

Users have limited visibility into how the software functions internally. This lack of transparency can lead to
uncertainty about how the software processes data, makes decisions, or handles errors.

## Limited Understanding:

Without access to the internal workings of the software, users may struggle to understand why
it behaves a certain way or produces certain results. This can make troubleshooting
difficult and hinder the ability to optimize or customize the software to meet specific needs.

# Difficulty in Debugging

When issues or errors arise, it can be challenging to diagnose the root cause without insight
into the internal mechanisms of the software. Debugging becomes more difficult when users cannot
examine the code directly.

# Dependency on Vendor

Users of black box software rely heavily on the vendor for support, updates, and fixes.
If the vendor discontinues support or goes out of business, users may face challenges in maintaining or
replacing the software.

# Security Risks

Without visibility into the software's internal workings, it is harder for users to
assess potential security vulnerabilities or risks. Malicious actors may exploit these vulnerabilities,
leading to data breaches or other security incidents.

# Compliance and Regulation

In regulated industries such as healthcare or finance, there may be requirements for
transparency and accountability in software systems. Black box software may struggle to
meet these compliance standards due to its lack of visibility.

# EmissionX

To address these issues, EmissionX is programmed with open source approach where
the source code is freely available for inspection and modification. Open-source software offers
greater transparency, enabling users to understand how the software works, contribute improvements,
and address security concerns more effectively.
