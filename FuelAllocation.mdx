## Fuel Allocation

### AQM v2.3 Fuel Consumption Calculation (Equation C.6-1)

[Alberta greenhouse gas quantification methodologies, AQM v2.3](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/alberta-greenhouse-gas-quantification-methodologies) provides methods to estimate fuel consumption for combustion equipment. However, a critical issue arises in Equation C.6-1, where the calculation does not accurately reflect energy input as intended.

The equation provided in AQM v2.3 for estimating fuel consumption is:

$$
v_{fuel,j,p} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{P_{rate,j}}{n_{j}} \times\frac{LF_{i}}{LHV_{j}} \times OH_{i} \times 0.0036
$$

where

- $v_{fuel,j,p}$ is estimated fuel consumption from combustion equipment for a specific fuel type for the reporting period, p (m3).
- $j$ is equipment type
- $P_{rate,j}$ is the maximum rated **input** power of the equipment j (kW).
- $LF_{j}$ is the load factor for each type of equipment j.
- $OH_{j}$ is the operating hours for each type of equipment j.
- $n_{j}$ is the thermal efficiency of the equipment j.
- $LHV_{j}$ is the lower heating value of the fuel for each type of equipment j (MJ/m3).
- 0.0036 Conversion factor for kWh to GJ.

The thermal efficiency $n_{j}$ represents the ratio of output energy to input energy:

$$
n_{j} = \frac{output}{input}
$$

When this efficiency factor is applied in AQM's equation, the calculation inadvertently represents energy output rather than input.

## API Fuel Calculation

American Petroleum Institute (API)'s [Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Natural Gas and Oil Industry, 2021](https://www.api.org/~/media/files/policy/esg/ghg/2021-api-ghg-compendium-110921.pdf) provides a correct methodology for calculating fuel consumption in Equation 4-5 and 4-6:

> API 2021 Equation 4-5.
>
> $$
> FC = ER \times LF \times OH \times ETT \times \frac{1}{HV}
> $$
>
> where,
>
> - FC is the fuel consumption (volumen/year)
> - ER is the equipment rate (hp,kW,or J)
> - LF is the load factor
> - OH is the operating hours
> - ETT is the equipment thermal efficiency (Btu <sub>input</sub> / hp-hr <sub>output</sub>, Btu<sub>input</sub> / kW-hr <sub>output</sub>, or J<sub>input</sub> / J <sub>output</sub>))
> - HV is the higher heating value

In the API 2021 compendium, thermal efficiency is represented as input-to-output (opposite to the standard output-to-input convention), and equipment rate is based on the equipment's output power, unlike AQM v2.3's focus on input power.

## Nameplate

The inconsistency between AQM v2.3 and API v2021 methodologies can be attributed to differences in nameplate power definitions:

- For boilers and heaters, the nameplate often indicates energy input[^1].
- In API v2021, the equipment rate corresponds to output energy.

## Correction to the AQM v2.3

The AQM Table C-1 and C-2 provide both thermal efficiency and load factors (based on fractions of maximum rated power output). This correction implies that $P_{rated,j}$ should represent output power, not input as stated in AQM v2.3.

- For engines and motors: Nameplate power indicates output power, so AQM v2.3's approach can convert output to input..

- For heaters and boilers: Nameplate power already represents input power, so dividing by thermal efficiency is unnecessary. The corrected equation for these types of equipment is:

$$
v_{fuel,j,p} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} P_{rate,j} \times\frac{LF_{i}}{LHV_{j}} \times OH_{i} \times 0.0036
$$

where

- $v_{fuel,j,p}$ is estimated fuel consumption from combustion equipment for a specific fuel type for the reporting period, p (m3).
- $j$ is equipment type
- $P_{rate,j}$ is the maximum rated **input** power of the equipment j (kW).
- $LF_{j}$ is the load factor for each type of equipment j.
- $OH_{j}$ is the operating hours for each type of equipment j.
- $LHV_{j}$ is the lower heating value of the fuel for each type of equipment j (MJ/m3).
- 0.0036 Conversion factor for kWh to GJ.

This correction aligns AQM with actual practice for fuel allocation calculations.

## Python Code

To illustrate this methodology, weâ€™ve included a Python function to calculate allocated fuel consumption based on nameplate power, operating hours, load factor, and thermal efficiency.

```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_allocated_fuel(row, df_clean):
    # Subset of the relevant block
    block = df_clean[(df_clean["Month"] == row["Month"]) & (df_clean["Phase"] == row["Phase"])]

    numerator = (row["Nameplate Power (kW)"] * row["Equipment Hours"] * row["Load"]) / row["Thermal Eff."]

    denominator = (
        (block["Nameplate Power (kW)"] * block["Equipment Hours"] * block["Load"]) / block["Thermal Eff."]
    ).sum()

    if denominator == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return row["Fuel"] * (numerator / denominator)

df_clean["Allocated Fuel"] = df_clean.apply(lambda row: calculate_allocated_fuel(row, df_clean), axis=1)

print("Updated DataFrame with Allocated Fuel:")
print(df_clean.head(18))
print(df_clean.tail(18))

file_path = 'path_to_your_file.xlsx'
with pd.ExcelWriter(file_path, mode='a') as writer:
    df_clean.to_excel(writer, index=False, sheet_name='Allocated Fuel Data')

print("Updated DataFrame with Allocated Fuel has been written to a new sheet in the original Excel file.")
```
