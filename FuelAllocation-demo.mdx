## Fuel Allocation

the fuel estimation is calculated based on [Alberta greenhouse gas quantification methodologies, AQM v2.3](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/alberta-greenhouse-gas-quantification-methodologies)

The equation is written as:

$$
v_{fuel,j,p} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{P_{rate,j}}{n_{j}} \times\frac{LF_{i}}{LHV_{j}} \times OH_{i} \times 0.0036
$$

where

- $v_{fuel,j,p}$ is estimated fuel consumption from combustion equipment for a specific fuel type for the reporting period, p (m3).
- $j$ is equipment type
- $P_{rate,j}$ is the maximum rated output power of the equipment j (kW).
- $LF_{j}$ is the load factor for each type of equipment j.
- $OH_{j}$ is the operating hours for each type of equipment j.
- $n_{j}$ is the thermal efficiency of the equipment j.
- $LHV_{j}$ is the lower heating value of the fuel for each type of equipment j (MJ/m3).
- 0.0036 Conversion factor for kWh to GJ.

The thermal efficiency $n_{j}$ represents the ratio of output energy to input energy:

$$
n_{j} = \frac{output}{input}
$$

LHV and the conversion factor 0.0036 is not needed for fuel allocation as they will be cancelled out. The above equation can be simplified as

$$
v_{fuel,j,p} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{P_{rate,j}}{n_{j}} \times{LF_{i}} \times OH_{i}
$$

where

- $v_{fuel,j,p}$ is estimated fuel consumption from combustion equipment for a specific fuel type for the reporting period, p (m3).
- $j$ is equipment type
- $P_{rate,j}$ is the maximum rated output power of the equipment j (kW).
- $LF_{j}$ is the load factor for each type of equipment j.
- $OH_{j}$ is the operating hours for each type of equipment j.
- $n_{j}$ is the thermal efficiency of the equipment j.

The allocation fuel to each equipment is calculated

$$
fuel_{j} = TotalFuel_{measured} \times \frac{Equipment_{j}}{v_{fuel}}
$$
